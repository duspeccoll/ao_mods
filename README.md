This plugin provides support for downloading MODS representations of Archival Objects in ArchivesSpace. It is no longer maintained as a separate plugin; its functionality has been merged into our larger [Digital Object Manager](https://github.com/duspeccoll/digital_object_manager) plugin. I leave it here for anyone interested in just the Archival Object MODS export capabilities.
