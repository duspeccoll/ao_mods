# ao_mods

a plugin to create MODS representations of archival objects in ArchivesSpace

I wrote this to try and make our digital object cataloging workflow simpler. It's still pretty early days yet but it ~~works~~ seems to work. You can only use it through the backend at the moment, but eventually I'd like to make it accessible through the frontend as well.
